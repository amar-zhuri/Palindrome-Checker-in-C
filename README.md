# Palindrome Checker in C

This C program checks if a sequence of numbers is a palindrome. It prompts the user to input the number of sequences, followed by each sequence's length and its respective numbers. The program then determines whether each sequence is a palindrome or not.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
gcc palindrome_checker.c -o palindrome_checker
2. Run the compiled executable:
./palindrome_checker
3. Enter the number of sequences followed by each sequence's length and numbers.

## Example
$ ./palindrome_checker
2
5 1 2 3 2 1
3 5 3 2
True
False

## Note
- The program checks each sequence for palindrome property.
- It outputs "True" if the sequence is a palindrome, otherwise "False".
